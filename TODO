For future releases:

* Enable bidirectional mode for ZMQ plugin.

* Head mode: jump to blockchain head and download ABI on the fly from a
  nodeos URL.

* Random access mode: start processing from an arbitrary block and
  download versions of ABI relevant to those blocks from an external
  server.

* irreversible-only mode

* stop-block option (stop processing at a given block)

* consider adding multiple threads in conveyor fashion: history receiver
  and decompression in one thread, JSON encoding in another, and
  exporter in a third thread.
